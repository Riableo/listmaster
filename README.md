# 🐲🐯 listmaster Animals or Criatures 🐶🐱

In this project, I had worked with *ListView* to create the items list of Animals or criatures.

![Items list](assets/images/mainapp.png)

I created an object called Animal with their attributes which are name, specie and type, then that were assigned for each new Animal that I was creating. 

On the other hand, when we have select an item of the list (**onTap**) with *GestureDetector* and *Navigator* widgets, we are going to other route that shows our animal selected.

This route was create with a class FichAnimal which make a new screen with only two items the image and a text like description of their animal type.
